NetroHost has announced that they are doing emergency maintenance on all of their services to recreate their network.

As such, a downtime is needed. Thats why from 6AM CET to 2PM CET, all of RixyNet will be down.

**This network rewrite should make NextSMP work again, like it did before, and make it actually enjoyable.**

Sorry for inconveniences.
